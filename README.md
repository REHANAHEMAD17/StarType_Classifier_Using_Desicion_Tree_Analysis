1.	Star Classification using Decision Tree

>> A machine learning project that classifies stars based on their physical attributes using a Decision Tree Classifier.

2.	Features

•	Classifies stars into different types (e.g., obj_ID	alpha	delta	u	g	r	i	z	run_ID	rerun_ID	cam_col	field_ID	spec_obj_ID	class	redshift	plate	MJD	fiber_ID
 etc.)

•	Uses a supervised learning approach with a Decision Tree Algorithms

•	Trained on astrophysical features like obj_ID	alpha	delta	u	g	r	i	z	run_ID	rerun_ID	cam_col	field_ID	spec_obj_ID	class	redshift	plate	MJD	fiber_ID

•	Visualizes the tree structure and evaluation metrics

3.	Tech Stack / Built With

Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Machine learning  Algorithms
Jupyter Notebook (optional)


4.	Installation
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/REHANAHEMAD17/star-classifier.git



  	5. Dataset
